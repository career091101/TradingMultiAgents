  "response": "{\n  \"analysis\": \"Although the recommendation is to HOLD with a high confidence level of 0.8, it's important to consider the lack of diversification in the current portfolio, which consists only of cash. While AAPL might be a strong investment, having all funds in one asset class exposes the portfolio to concentrated risk. Diversification could help mitigate potential losses in case of adverse movements in the stock. Therefore, it's advisable to consider allocating a portion of the cash to other assets to spread risk and potentially increase returns in the long run.\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }\n}",
