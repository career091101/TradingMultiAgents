This approach minimizes risk in a fluctuating market.\n\nポートフォリオ状況:\n- 現金比率: 100.0%\n- 含み損益: $0.00\n\nあなたの立場からリスク評価を行ってください。\n\n\nPlease respond in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"string\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }\n}",
  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"The decision to hold AAPL is a prudent approach given the current market conditions and the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future movements. With a cash ratio of 100%, the portfolio is well-positioned to absorb potential market fluctuations without incurring losses. Holding allows for the possibility of clearer signals before making any new investments, thereby protecting capital and minimizing risk exposure.\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": 0.7,\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": \"The rationale for holding is based on the current trading price of AAPL at 214.40, alongside the observation that the market sentiment is fluctuating. The recommendation to wait for clearer signals of upward momentum is a strategic approach to avoid premature investments that could lead to losses in an unpredictable market environment.\"\n}\n```",
