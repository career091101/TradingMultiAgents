  "response": "{\n  \"analysis\": \"The current portfolio being entirely in cash signifies a very conservative risk management strategy with a focus on capital preservation. While this approach minimizes the risk of loss, it also limits potential returns due to the lack of diversification into other assets. Given the context of zero unrealized P&L and 100% cash ratio, the risk exposure is low but so is the opportunity for growth. It may be worth considering diversifying the portfolio to seek higher returns while still maintaining a prudent level of risk.\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": 0.6\n  },\n  \"rationale\": {\n    \"type\": \"While maintaining a 100% cash position aligns with conservative risk management principles, exploring opportunities for diversification could balance risk and return more effectively.\"\n  }\n}",
