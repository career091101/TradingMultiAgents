  "prompt": "\n以下の取引提案を評価してください。\n\n取引提案:\n- アクション: HOLD\n- 確信度: 0.7\n- 理由: The investment plan suggests monitoring current market conditions and any changes in AAPL's fundamentals. Given that there is no current position and the market shows stable behavior around the current price, it is prudent to hold cash and wait for a clearer entry signal based on the evolving market landscape.\n\nポートフォリオ状況:\n- 現金比率: 100.0%\n- 含み損益: $0.00\n\nあなたの立場からリスク評価を行ってください。\n\n\nPlease respond in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"string\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }\n}",
  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"The recommendation to hold cash is a careful approach considering the current market stability and the lack of a position in AAPL. While the confidence level of 0.7 indicates a reasonable expectation for future movements, there are opportunities to consider. Holding cash allows for flexibility to take advantage of potential price dips or clearer signals for entry. However, remaining entirely in cash limits exposure to potential gains in a rising market. A balanced strategy might involve allocating a small portion of cash to AAPL to capture upside while maintaining a majority in cash for flexibility.\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": 0.7,\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": \"Maintaining a cash position provides a buffer against market volatility and allows for strategic entry points as market conditions evolve. While the current hold recommendation is prudent, consider implementing a phased approach to investing that allows for both risk management and potential upside capture.\"\n}\n```",
