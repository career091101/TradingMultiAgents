  "prompt": "\n以下の取引提案を評価してください。\n\n取引提案:\n- アクション: HOLD\n- 確信度: 0.7\n- 理由: The investment plan suggests monitoring current market conditions and any changes in AAPL's fundamentals. Given that there is no current position and the market shows stable behavior around the current price, it is prudent to hold cash and wait for a clearer entry signal based on the evolving market landscape.\n\nポートフォリオ状況:\n- 現金比率: 100.0%\n- 含み損益: $0.00\n\nあなたの立場からリスク評価を行ってください。\n\n\nPlease respond in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"string\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }\n}",
  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"The decision to HOLD is a prudent approach given the current market conditions and the absence of a position in AAPL. The 100% cash holding provides a buffer against potential market volatility. By adopting a cautious stance and closely monitoring AAPL's fundamentals and market movements, the investor minimizes the risk of loss while remaining prepared to capitalize on future opportunities.\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": 0.7,\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": \"Holding cash at this moment, especially with the market showing stable behavior around the current price of AAPL, allows for flexibility and reduces exposure to potential losses. This strategy aligns with a conservative risk management approach that prioritizes capital preservation and waits for a more favorable entry point.\"\n}\n```",
