  "prompt": "\n以下の取引提案を評価してください。\n\n取引提案:\n- アクション: HOLD\n- 確信度: 0.7\n- 理由: Given the current market conditions with AAPL trading near 214.40 and the investment plan suggesting to monitor the stock, it is prudent to hold off on any positions until clearer signals of upward momentum or favorable sentiment emerge. This approach minimizes risk in a fluctuating market.\n\nポートフォリオ状況:\n- 現金比率: 100.0%\n- 含み損益: $0.00\n\nあなたの立場からリスク評価を行ってください。\n\n\nPlease respond in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"string\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }\n}",
  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"The current recommendation to hold AAPL is a cautious approach in a fluctuating market. With AAPL trading around 214.40 and a confidence level of 0.7, there is reasonable potential for upward movement. However, the lack of clear momentum signals indicates that entering a position now could be premature. Holding allows for the preservation of capital while waiting for more favorable conditions. This strategy can be beneficial, especially when the cash ratio is at 100%, allowing for quick repositioning when an opportunity arises.\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": 0.7,\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": \"The rationale for holding is based on the current market conditions and the absence of signals indicating a strong upward trend for AAPL. By holding, the portfolio minimizes risk exposure while maintaining liquidity to capitalize on future opportunities. This approach aligns with the principle of calculated risk-taking, allowing for potential high returns without overexposing capital in a volatile environment.\"\n}\n```",
