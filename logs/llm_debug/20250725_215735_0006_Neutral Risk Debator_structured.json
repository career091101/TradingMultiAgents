  "prompt": "\n以下の取引提案を評価してください。\n\n取引提案:\n- アクション: HOLD\n- 確信度: 0.7\n- 理由: Given the current market conditions with AAPL trading near 214.40 and the investment plan suggesting to monitor the stock, it is prudent to hold off on any positions until clearer signals of upward momentum or favorable sentiment emerge. This approach minimizes risk in a fluctuating market.\n\nポートフォリオ状況:\n- 現金比率: 100.0%\n- 含み損益: $0.00\n\nあなたの立場からリスク評価を行ってください。\n\n\nPlease respond in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"string\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }\n}",
  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"The recommendation to hold AAPL is based on the current market conditions where the stock is trading at 214.40. With a confidence level of 0.7, this suggests a moderate belief in the decision to wait for clearer upward momentum before taking any positions. Given that the portfolio currently has a 100% cash ratio and no existing positions, this strategy effectively minimizes risk in a volatile market. Waiting for more favorable signals could potentially lead to better investment outcomes while avoiding the pitfalls of entering during uncertain conditions.\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": 0.7,\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": \"Holding off on making any positions allows for the opportunity to gather more data and market signals. Given the lack of existing investments and a strong cash position, this cautious approach is advisable to mitigate risk while searching for a more advantageous entry point.\"\n}\n```",
