This approach minimizes exposure to market volatility and potential losses. However, the absence of action may also lead to missed opportunities for returns in a changing market environment. The lack of certainty in the proposal suggests the need for further analysis or market signals before making any commitments, which is a prudent stance given current uncertainties.\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": 0.5,\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": \"With the portfolio entirely in cash, there is an opportunity to observe market conditions before engaging in investments. This cautious approach is advisable in uncertain times; however, it remains essential to stay alert for potential investment opportunities that could yield positive returns once market clarity is achieved.\"\n}\n```",
