  "prompt": "\n以下の取引提案を評価してください。\n\n取引提案:\n- アクション: HOLD\n- 確信度: 0.7\n- 理由: The investment plan suggests monitoring current market conditions and any changes in AAPL's fundamentals. Given that there is no current position and the market shows stable behavior around the current price, it is prudent to hold cash and wait for a clearer entry signal based on the evolving market landscape.\n\nポートフォリオ状況:\n- 現金比率: 100.0%\n- 含み損益: $0.00\n\nあなたの立場からリスク評価を行ってください。\n\n\nPlease respond in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"string\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }\n}",
  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"The decision to hold cash and monitor the market conditions around AAPL is a cautious approach given the current stable behavior of the stock price and the absence of any existing positions. Holding a 100% cash position minimizes the risk of exposure to potential market downturns, especially in an uncertain economic environment. However, the confidence level of 0.7 indicates a reasonable level of assurance in this strategy, acknowledging that there could be market movements that might present better opportunities.\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": 0.7,\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": \"The rationale for holding cash is well-founded as it allows for flexibility in responding to future market changes. The current market state shows stability in AAPL's price without significant volatility, which aligns with the strategy of waiting for a clearer entry signal. This approach balances the risk of premature investment against the opportunity cost of holding cash, especially when considering the potential for better entry points in the future.\"\n}\n```",
