This may be suitable for a risk-averse investor looking to maintain a conservative stance. However, it's important to consider the opportunity cost of holding cash instead of being invested in potentially profitable assets.\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": 0.8,\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": {\n    \"type\": \"The recommendation to hold AAPL aligns with a conservative risk approach given the high cash ratio in the portfolio.
