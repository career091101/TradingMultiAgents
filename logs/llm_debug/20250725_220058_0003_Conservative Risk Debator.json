  "response": "{\n  \"analysis\": \"The current portfolio consisting entirely of cash indicates a very conservative risk management approach, focusing on capital preservation. While cash is a safe asset, the lack of diversification limits potential returns. However, given the high cash ratio and zero unrealized P&L, the risk of loss is minimized. Considering the context of capital preservation and the absence of potential losses, maintaining the current cash position aligns with conservative risk management principles.\",\n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"type\": 1,\n    \"minimum\": 0,\n    \"maximum\": 1\n  },\n  \"rationale\": {\n    \"type\": \"Maintaining a 100% cash position minimizes risk of loss and aligns with a conservative risk management strategy focused on capital preservation.\"\n  }\n}",
