# CircularBuffer Fix Summary

## Issue
The backtest system was failing with the error: `'CircularBuffer' object is not iterable`

## Root Cause
The `CircularBuffer` class (used to prevent memory leaks) doesn't support direct iteration. Code was trying to iterate over CircularBuffer instances using `for item in buffer:` syntax.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. PositionManager (position_manager.py)
**Line 318**: Fixed iteration over closed_positions
```python
# Before:
realized_pnl = sum(p.realized_pnl for p in self.closed_positions)

# After:
realized_pnl = sum(p.realized_pnl for p in self.closed_positions.get_all())
```

### 2. BacktestEngine (engine.py)
**Line 298**: Fixed iteration over transactions
```python
# Before:
return [t for t in self.transactions if t.timestamp.date() == date.date()]

# After:
return [t for t in self.transactions.get_all() if t.timestamp.date() == date.date()]
```

## Verification
Created and ran test script `test_circular_buffer_fix.py` which confirmed:
- ✅ PositionManager.get_portfolio_state() works correctly
- ✅ BacktestEngine._get_daily_transactions() works correctly
- ✅ Transaction history access works correctly

## Prevention
When using CircularBuffer, always use the `.get_all()` method to get an iterable list:
```python
# Correct usage:
for item in circular_buffer.get_all():
    # process item

# Incorrect usage (will fail):
for item in circular_buffer:
    # This will raise TypeError
```

## Status
✅ All CircularBuffer iteration issues have been resolved. The backtest system should now run without these errors.
